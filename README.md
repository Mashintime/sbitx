A 64 bit version of the sBITX OS for the HF Signals sBitx hardware. Credit goes to the developers at HF Signals and A. Farhan for writing the initial code. Honorable mentions to Rafael, Dave, and Jerry for carving the path for us with 64Bit libraries and instructions. This version was recompiled and modified by J. Kujawa.

The files here are to designed to work with the precompiled image since additional libraries are missing. Install the Pi image to obtain full functionality as described below.

A preconfigured, downloadable Raspberry Pi 4 image file is available as a beta release. This Pi image is designed to fit a 32GB SD card or USB drive and installed with Balena Etcher. As a bonus, sBITX Toolbox is preinstalled on the image as well as other useful tools for ham radio use.
