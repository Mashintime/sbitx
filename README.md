An improved version of the sBitx application designed for the sBitx hardware. Credit goes to the developers at HF Signals and A. Farhan for writing the initial code. 

Honorable mentions to Rafael D., Dave C., and Jerry P. for carving the path for us with library conversion and instructions. This version was recompiled and modified by J. Kujawa.

The files here are to designed to replace the sBitx application and work on the default, 32 bit (stock) sBitx as shipped and the modified, 64 bit version provided in the *Releases* section.


The stand-alone version of sBitx toolbox for 32 bit is available [HERE](https://github.com/drexjj/sBITX-toolbox)

The stand-alone version of sBitx toolbox for 64 bit is available [HERE](https://github.com/drexjj/sBITX-toolbox64)


****Backup Your Data First!****
-----
It is important to backup your existing sbitx/data and sbitx/web folders to a safe place before installing this version. A good data backup strategy is important so you do not lose your logbook, hardware calibration, and user settings.

You can make a copy of your original sbitx folder in entirety by using this set of commands from terminal
```console
cd $HOME
mv sbitx sbitx_orig
```
You can restore the sbitx/data and sbitx/web folders from your backup to the newly installed sbitx folder using these commands from terminal
```console
cd $HOME
cp -r sbitx_orig/web/* sbitx/web/
cp -r sbitx_orig/data/* sbitx/data/
```

sBitx App Installation
-----

Open terminal and type (or copy and paste this):

```console
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/drexjj/sbitx.git
cd sbitx
./update
```


****Download The 64 Bit Image****
-----
A preconfigured, downloadable Raspberry Pi 4 image file is available as a beta release. This Pi image is designed to fit a 32GB SD card or USB drive and installed with Balena Etcher.

As a bonus, sBITX Toolbox is preinstalled on the image as well as other useful tools for ham radio use.

A new beta version is available [HERE](https://github.com/drexjj/sbitx/releases)


****Download The 32 Bit Image****
-----
A 32 bit image will be available in the future. It is highly advised to NOT use 32 bit because support for the operating system will no longer provide security patches or feature enhancements in June 2024.

The 32 bit version will be provided for experimental use or to reload back to the stock configuration.
