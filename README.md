An improved version of the sBitx application designed for the sBitx hardware. Credit goes to the developers at HF Signals and A. Farhan for writing the initial code. Honorable mentions to Rafael D., Dave C., and Jerry P. for carving the path for us with library conversion and instructions. This version was recompiled and modified by J. Kujawa.
